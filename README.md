## Deliverables

- A project report (e.g., about 10 pages when using the IEEE template)
- For proof-of-concept implementation, in addition to the above report, also submit
  - source code
  - README
  - CSV producing the tables and/or plotted figures/graphs in the Experimental Evaluation section (so that we could modify/redraw the figures)

## Project Outline

1. Introduction (includes motivation, potential real-life applications). At the end of the Introduction (say, Section 1.1), pls explicitly list your contributions of this work (e.g., a new design, an efficient algorithm, additional features, new insights)
2. Background & related work (e.g., point out shortcomings of the existing work, compare & contrast with the existing work)
3. main body (includes description of your new idea, step-by-step illustrative examples, pseudo codes, highlight of any differences between your work vs. existing works)
4. analytical (e.g., theorems) and empirical evaluation (e.g., experiments, tables & figures, explanations on experimental results)
5. conclusions, limitations, and future work
6. references (e.g., cite at least 10 refereed books, journals, and/or conference papers; websites do NOT counted)

Data Available we want to use?

- Water Temperature
- Salinity

Fixed time interval dataset using clustering methods and represented using Data Visualization:

- Cluster water temperature and salinity data into distinct clusters and visually represent them on a map (using coloured regions)
  - Clusters could be represented as a geographical region
  - User specify how many different clusters of temperature they want represented then data clustered appropriately
  - Change saturation of colour based on salinity value

## Algorithm

Clustering algorithm idea:

- Determine min/max range
- Input # of desired clusters, evenly split the clusters among that range in the form of temperature ranges
- Adjust the groups one by one until theyâ€™re all roughly even, same # of points or same geographical area
- Plot them w/ different colours on a map projection
