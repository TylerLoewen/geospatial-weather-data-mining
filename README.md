**Note:** as there isn't enough space in our submission to include all visualizations/data, please find supplemental materials [here](https://umanitoba-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/loewent4_myumanitoba_ca/ErSyuuZR8AtNr6r5UH97I9QB4hOiCpsz2mECRm1mhPNkIw?email=Carson.Leung%40umanitoba.ca&e=u8cmby).

## Directory Overview

### [Visuals](Visuals)

Contains a subset of our visualizations. We created two different visualizations: a map, and a line graph. Each type of visualization has been created with different values of k for our k-mean algorithm. More details can be found in [Visuals](Visuals/README.md)

### [Data](Data)

The directory containing the data. Required by `Scripts` to function.

Also contains `.csv` data used in our performance analysis of the improved algorithm in [Data/performance](Data/performance)

> Note: the data used for our visualization covers an entire year (2019) and was too large to include in the submission. It can be found [here](https://umanitoba-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/loewent4_myumanitoba_ca/EQG2MReOZBhNu13[â€¦]cFmEMYTzeigQ?email=Carson.Leung%40umanitoba.ca&e=fpylcC). We have included a single day of data [Data/EAR5-01-01-2020.nc](Data/EAR5-01-01-2020.nc) for completeness sake.

### [Report](Report)

Contains report `.tex` source files and related figures.

### [Scripts](Scripts)

Contains all implementations such as clustering algorithms, data pre-processing, and visualization generation. More detail can be found in [Scripts/README.md](Scripts/README.md)
