## Directory Overview

### [Visuals](Visuals)

Contains a subset of our visualizations. We created two different visualizations: a map, and a line graph. Each type of visualization has been created with different values of k for our k-mean algorithm. More details can be found in [Visuals/README.md](Visuals/README.md)

### `Data`

Note: as our data was too large to include here, the data can be found [here](https://umanitoba-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/loewent4_myumanitoba_ca/EQG2MReOZBhNu13[â€¦]cFmEMYTzeigQ?email=Carson.Leung%40umanitoba.ca&e=fpylcC)
The directory containing the data. Required by `Scripts` to function.

### `Report`

Contains report `.tex` source files and related figures.

### `Scripts`

Contains all implementations such as clustering algorithms, data pre-processing, and visualization generation. More detail can be found in [Scripts/README.md](Scripts/README.md)
